# FLOS
> A rhythm game in harmony with blossoms.

### About

"flos" is my first attempt of rhythm game, built with ***Godot Engine***.

### Inspiration and ideas

How long has it been since you last directly face your inner heart?
When you get lost and forget the path we came by, just calm down and listen to the peaceful voice.
See, there is no need to rush. Have some time to stay with yourself and enjoy the blossoms.
